# SORT-ALGORITHMS  

A comprehensive collection of sorting algorithm implementations in C. This repository provides efficient, well-documented examples of sorting techniques to help developers and students understand and compare their functionality and performance.  

## Algorithms Included  
The repository includes the following sorting algorithms:  
- **Bubble Sort**  
- **Selection Sort**  
- **Quick Sort**  
- **Merge Sort**  
- **Heap Sort**  
- **Radix Sort**  
- More algorithms will be added soon!

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- GCC Compiler (or any C compiler)  

### Compilation  
To compile a specific sorting algorithm, use the following command:  
```bash  
gcc src/bubble_sort.c -o bubble_sort  
```  

### Running Tests  
Test the algorithms using the provided test files in the `tests/` folder. For example:  
```bash  
gcc tests/test_bubble_sort.c -o test_bubble_sort  
./test_bubble_sort  
```  

## Documentation  
Each algorithm includes detailed explanations, complexity analysis, and sample cases in the `docs/` folder.
